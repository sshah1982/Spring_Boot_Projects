# Spring_Boot_Projects

This Spring Boot project is a multi-module project containing parent POM and children. I've used latest version of all dependencies and incorporated all best practices 
with coding standards.

In the 2nd iteration, I'm planning to implement Exception Handling, Incremental Load and Parallel Load also.

(1) Migration-service module contains code and configuration for MySQL relational DB to NoSQL MongoDB data migration using Spring batch job. 

(2) Mongo-redis-crud-service contains CRUD operations using MongoDB as NoSQL and Redis as cache mechanism.
